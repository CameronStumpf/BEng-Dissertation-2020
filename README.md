Machine Learning in Financial Engineering

This final year dissertation project was undertaked as a component of my undergraduate
Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Cardiff University (2016-2020).  The 
project saught to compare and evaluate the relative efficacy of ensemble decision tree
and neural network machine learning methods when applied to stock market forecasting.

The project found that whilst neural network methods are capable of significantly more
accurate forecasts over longer forecast periods, they are highly sensitive to the 
available data and hyperparameter selection; in situations with less available data and 
with fewer unique features the decision tree methods consistenly outperform neural
network experiments.

Abstract:
Supervised machine learning methods are widely used in financial engineering applications
to generate forecasts of future consumer trends and market behaviours, the accuracy of
which may determine the future success of said business or venture; these methods have
historically taken the form of decision tree ensemble methods, however, more cutting edge
neural network methods are seeing increasing use. In this dissertation: gradient boosted
decision trees, random forests, and ensemble neural network methods are used to generate
forecasts for the behaviour of the NASDAQ100 stock market index; the project seeks to
determine each modelâ€™s relative suitability for financial forecasting applications by
evaluating the sensitivity of their forecast accuracies subject to variations in model
hyperparameter selection and data availability across short to medium ranges.
